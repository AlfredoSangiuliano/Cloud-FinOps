# Cloud-FinOps

As part of a AWS learning path, after each sprint of the program, we have to clean-up a group of AWS Sandbox accounts.

Initially, we performed a manual cleanup of resources created by the students.
Now I am writing some small python tools to help automate the cleanup process and/or gain more control over spending. Using Boto3 AWS library. 

The main goal of these efforts is to:
- Gain intelligent insights into spending during the sprint in a timely manner,
- Automate the cleanup process,
- Align with the Fin-Ops methodology.
